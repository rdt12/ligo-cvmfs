# ligo-cvmfs

This repository contains a couple of scripts that I find useful for
installing [publicly available LIGO software](https://wiki.ligo.org/Computing/ScientificLinux7) and connecting to
[Gravitational Wave Open Science Center data sources](https://www.gw-openscience.org/about) via [CVMFS](https://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem).

They should work on a fresh [SL7 install](https://www.scientificlinux.org/).

Just run them as root. Like any scripts that you download, you should at least
give them a look to make sure that they are not doing something malicious.
